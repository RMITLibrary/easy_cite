###### start-subtype-content

The Chicago referencing style is widely used in art, design, architecture, music, history and humanities subjects. The Chicago Manual of Style includes detailed advice on citing and referencing sources used in these disciplines, including artworks, live performances and historical sources, as well as commonly-used source types such as books, journal articles and websites. 

This guide is based on <a href="https://rmit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/61RMIT_INST/1adn3cm/alma9921991311601341">The Chicago Manual of Style 17th edition</a>. Please refer to this manual if you need more examples than those included in this guide, or if you need clarification. 

There are two formats of referencing within the Chicago referencing style. One is **notes and bibliography (Chicago A)** and the other is **author-date (Chicago B)**. This guide provides examples and advice for the **notes and bibliography** format.  

The **notes and bibliography** format uses a **numerical** system of footnotes or endnotes. Footnotes require the writer to mark the in-text citation with a superscript number and provide a reference citation within the footnote. Throughout the document, citations are numbered in sequential order. A bibliography is included at the end of the document in **alphabetical** order. 

**Important:** this is a guide only. To avoid losing marks, confirm referencing requirements with your educators.

### General rules for notes - footnotes and endnotes

###### start-subtype-content

Always check with your tutor or lecturer about any specific requirements they have around referencing.

#### Notes - Footnotes or Endnotes

- Each time you paraphrase, summarise, or use a direct quote in your paper, include a note to cite your source. A note can be a footnote or an endnote.

- A note number should be placed at the end of a sentence or clause, and after the punctuation.

- Footnotes can be found at the bottom of each page, i.e. in the footer, whereas endnotes are placed at the end of the document, chapter or section of writing.

- Notes require you to mark all in-text citations with a superscript number and provide a citation in the note. Notes should be numbered in sequential order.

- Previous editions of the Chicago Manual of Style recommended the use of *ibid.* (from *ibidem*, “in the same place”) when repeating a citation in footnotes. Unlike previous editions, the 17th ed. of the Chicago Manual of Style discourages the use of *ibid.* in favour of shortened citations.

- Chicago does not require you to include an access date unless no date of publication or revision can be determined from the source. However, you may wish to check with your lecturer first as they may have a preference for including access dates.

- The first line of your note should be indented .5" from the left of the page, or 5 spaces.

Example;

> {.footnote-indent}1. Doug Patt, *How to Architect* (Cambridge, Mass: MIT Press. 2012), 28.{/.footnote-indent}

**When do I use a shortened note?**

The first time you cite a source in a note, include all the recommended citation information. If you cite that same source again, use a shortened note.

- Author full-names are shortened to Family Name.

- Titles are shortened if longer than four words.

- Include the relevant page numbers.

- Include a note number.

- Ensure that the first line of your note is .5" from the left of the page, or 5 spaces.

Example;

> {.footnote-indent}2. Patt, *How to Architect,* 35.{/.footnote-indent}

#### Shortening a title

- The order of words should not be changed.

- Initial articles like “the” or “a” may be removed.

- Key words from the original title should be retained.

- Ensure the first part of the short citation matches what is listed in the bibliography.

- A short title is italicised or placed in "quotation marks" based on the full title.

#### Block quotations

- Block quotations should be used for quotes longer than five lines.

- Do not use quotation marks for block quotations.

- Block quotations are indented from the left (and sometimes from the right also).

- Block quotations require their own footnote.

- Quotation marks can be used within a block quotation when including a separate quote within the text.

#### Create a footnote in Word

1. Place your curser at the end of the sentence, after the punctuation.

2. Click ***References***.

3. Select ***Insert Footnote***.

4. A superscript number will appear in your text.

5. In the footer, place your footnote. Remember that you will need to indent the first line of the footnote by 5 spaces.

### General rules for bibliography

###### start-subtype-content

#### Basic rules to create a bibliography

- A bibliography includes all sources cited within the text, as well as any additional sources consulted.

- Place the bibliography at the end of your work on a new page.

- Title the page, *Bibliography,* and centre the title.

- Arrange the list of works in alphabetical order according to the family name of the author or editor.

- Author's names are inverted for the bibliography - Family Name, Given Name.

- Capitalise all titles.

- If the author is unknown, begin the reference with the title of work.

#### Create a hanging indent using Microsoft Word

The second line of each bibliography entry has a hanging indent.

##### To create a hanging indent in Microsoft Word;

1.  Highlight all text (Shift + A).

2.  Right click (Shift + F10).

3.  Select ***paragraph***.

4.  Under the heading, ***Indentation**,* select the drop-down box for ***Special*** and select ***Hanging***.

Unless the word blog is already part of the title, as in the LSE Impact Blog example below, the blog title should be followed word *blog*, in parentheses. Titles of blog posts are placed in quotation marks.

Blogs that are part of a larger publication should also include the name of that publication as in the LSE example below.

Comments can usually be cited in the text, in reference to the related post. If the comment is cited in a note, list the name of the commenter and the date of the comment, followed by the information for the related post.

### Social media

###### start-subtype-content

As social media content is usually untitled, use the text of the post itself (up to 160 characters) in place of a title.

If an author's screen-name is available, include it in parentheses after their name. If only the screen-name is known, use that instead of the author's name.

Include the name of the social media site, and if relevant, include the type of post (photo, video) as in the Twitter example below.

To find a direct URL for a Facebook post, use the search function on the Facebook page to find the post and then copy the URL.

Social media comments should be cited in reference to the related post and in the shortened form.

Private content, including direct messages, is considered a form of personal communication.

### General guidelines for visual materials

<!-- first accordion item -->
###### start-subtype-content

Visual materials can include illustrations, photographs, images, paintings, diagrams, maps and graphs.

Visual materials that you use in your assignment or for study purposes do not need the copyright permissions that are required for publishing or commercial use. However, it is essential that you give credit to the creator of the work and reference it in your work. This can be done using a caption or a note.

Citations are also influenced by the location of where you found the image or creative work. Where possible, cite the original rather than a reproduction.

Visual materials from books, articles and other sources that you refer to but don’t reproduce should be cited in the standard format of the source as described in the other sections of this guide.

Visual materials are not usually included in a bibliography. Some courses might request a list of illustrations or figures.

Your lecturer may have specific requirements for referencing illustrations and artworks. Any directions given by your lecturer must be followed, even if they differ from this guide.

###### start-subtype-item

### Captions

###### start-subtype-content

#### Using Captions

Captions are used to provide a description of illustrations, images and artworks. These are usually placed below the illustration.

A figure number is used in the caption to identify each illustration. These figures are numbered sequentially in the order in which they appear.

Illustrations you create of your own work are not usually referenced. However, a caption such as “Figure 7. Photograph by author” or “Figure 11. Initial sketches” might be appropriate when other illustrations in your assignment are referenced.

Make sure you refer to the figure in your writing and include the figure number. The word figure is always written in full and lower case, except when in parentheses when it is abbreviated (fig. 1).

#### Caption rule (Own work)

Figure number. Description or explanation.

##### Caption example

> {.figure-text}Figure 1. Author’s photograph showing design development.{/.figure-text}

#### Caption rule (reproduced artwork)

Figure number. Artist’s Given Name Artist’s Family Name, *Title of work*, Year produced. Medium. Source - Publishing details of where you found it.

#### AI-generated text

##### Using generative artificial intelligence (AI) in learning and research, including assessment tasks

The educators within your courses can tell you if you are able to use artificial intelligence (AI) tools in your assessment tasks, including how you can use the tools and what tools you can use. If you use any AI tools, you must appropriately acknowledge and reference the use of these tools and their outputs. Failure to reference the use of these tools can result in academic misconduct.

**Please confirm with your course educator**  before using any AI tools in your assessment tasks.

**Please note**  that the guidelines on how to reference AI tools have been updated on Monday the 26th of June 2023. This is in response to updated guidelines from the APA style manual editors, as well as the new ability to generate shareable URLs in some of the AI tools.

#### Overview of text-generating AI tools

##### Introduction to AI tools that can generate text

AI tools that generate text, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, are large language models with a conversational type of interface, where you can ask a question, receive a detailed response and follow up with additional queries.

Some generative AI tools are not connected to the internet and are trained on data sets up to a specific time point. Other generative AI tools connect to the internet and will provide URL links to information. There are some points to consider when using the text generated by these tools:

-   As these tools function in a similar way to predictive text on your phone, by recognising and reproducing patterns in language, they can generate incorrect information.
-   While they can produce citations and references, these are not always correct. If you are relying on the information to be accurate, you should check that the reference cited by the AI tool exists, and that the information cited is present in the original source.
-   The data sets used to train these tools often include biased and inaccurate information, as access to scholarly information and valid scientific studies may be limited, and information from social media and other less reputable sources is included.
   
The  [Learning Lab Artificial Intelligence Tools module](https://learninglab.rmit.edu.au/university-essentials/artificial-intelligence-tools/)  has more information on how these AI tools work, and some points to consider when using them.

##### Copyright and non-human authors

Current copyright law only recognises humans as authors and creators. One of the moral rights associated with copyright is the right to be acknowledged as the author of a work. From a copyright perspective an AI tool cannot be  [recognised as the creator of a work](https://www.artslaw.com.au/information-sheet/artificial-intelligence-ai-and-copyright/), however it is important to explain that an AI tool was used in the creation of the work. This has informed our referencing guidance.

##### General acknowledgement that AI tools have been used in the creation of a work

In some assessment tasks, you may be able to use AI tools for background research, or to generate an outline for your essay or report (as stated earlier, please follow your educator's guidance before using any AI tools).. In this case, rather than citing and referencing specific text generated by AI tools, you will need to provide a general acknowledgement within the body or methods section of your text to explain that an AI tool was used in the creation of your work. Include as much detail as possible, including how you used the AI tool, the prompt used, the date you used the tool, and the name, creator and version of the AI tool.

Example: On the 26th June 2023, I used the May 24 version of OpenAI's ChatGPT to perform background research by using the following prompt "explain the difference between deep learning and machine learning".

##### Referencing specific text content generated by AI tools

Each of the referencing styles used at RMIT is based on a source style manual. More information on the source style manuals used for each style can be found in [Easy Cite](https://www.lib.rmit.edu.au/easy-cite/). Currently, only the editors of the APA style manual have provided advice on referencing AI-generated content. For the other referencing styles used at RMIT, we have created interim guidelines for referencing AI-generated content that we believe are the best match within that style. These may change in the future as the source style manuals develop or update their guidelines for referencing AI-generated content.  

If you are referring to content generated by AI tools within your work, we recommend that you include the shareable link to the content if available, or otherwise include this AI-generated content as an appendix or supplemental information. It is also good practice to include the question or prompt that generated the response to provide context for your readers. 

Two sets of reference guidelines are provided below for each style - one is for AI tools that include shareable URLs to the outputs generated from text prompts, which enables your readers to access the outputs themselves.  The other is for AI tools that do not provide shareable links, meaning that the readers of your work cannot access the same information themselves. 

#### AI-generated images

##### Using generative AI in learning and research, including assessment tasks

Your course lecturer can tell you if you are able to use content generated by artificial intelligence (AI) tools in your assessment tasks, including AI-generated images.  **Please confirm with your course lecturer**  for a specific assessment task before using any AI tools.

If you are able to use AI tools in your assessment task, you need to appropriately acknowledge and reference all of the AI-generated content that you include. Failure to reference this AI-generated content can result in  [academic misconduct](https://www.rmit.edu.au/students/my-course/assessment-results/academic-integrity).

**Please note**  that the information about using generative AI tools will continue to be updated - we recommend checking this guide regularly and confirming with your course lecturer if you are unsure.

##### Overview of images generated by AI tools

Some generative AI tools have been trained on large numbers of existing images, and these tools can create new images based on prompts from users. The images created using these tools can be downloaded, but they are not published or reproducible in the AI platform. Images generated using AI tools such as Midjourney and DALL-E 2 are the topic of much debate. Current copyright law only recognises humans as authors. One of the moral rights associated with copyright is the right to be acknowledged as the author of a work. From a copyright perspective there is currently no obligation to  [recognise AI as the creator of a work](https://www.artslaw.com.au/information-sheet/artificial-intelligence-ai-and-copyright/), however it is important to explain that AI was used in the creation of the work.

AI-generated images are an emerging technology, and there are not yet clear guidelines for how to incorporate them into existing referencing styles such as APA 7th, Chicago, etc. Our current recommendation for how to reference AI-generated images varies for each referencing style, and is included below. Additionally, we recommend that you include the question or prompt that generated the image where possible, to provide context for your readers.

**Please note**  that our recommendations for how to reference AI-generated content may change in the future as referencing style manuals are updated.

### Referencing guidelines for AI-generated content

###### start-subtype-content

#### How to reference AI-generated text

The Chicago Manual of Style editors have released a [Q&A post on referencing AI-generated text](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/qanda/data/faq/topics/Documentation/faq0422.html). We have adapted these guidelines to accommodate the current Australian copyright advice that AI tools cannot be listed as authors. Instead, use the creator of the tool as the author in the in-text citation and provide bibliographic details in a reference list entry.

If a shareable URL to the content is available, include it in your reference list entry. If the content is not shareable, include the prompt used and the output generated in an appendix. Include the general URL for the tool and a note about the appendix in the reference list entry.

**Chicago A (Notes-Bibliography) style** uses numbered in-text citations that match the corresponding footnote or endnote entry.

#### Footnote example - shareable URL generated by the AI tool:

##### Rule

> {.hanging-indent}Note number. AI tool used, Month Day, Year, Creator of tool, URL.{/.hanging-indent}

##### Example

> {.hanging-indent}1. Text generated using ChatGPT, June 26, 2023, OpenAI, https<nolink>://chat.openai.com/share/81f2e81f-f137-41b6-9881-39af1672ae3c{/.hanging-indent}

#### Footnote example - non-shareable AI-generated content:

##### Rule

> {.hanging-indent}Note number. AI tool used, Month Day, Year, Creator of tool, URL, Appendix.{/.hanging-indent}

##### Example

> {.hanging-indent}1. Text generated using Claude, January 22, 2024, Anthropic, https://claude.ai/chats, see Appendix for prompt used and output generated.{/.hanging-indent}

#### How to reference AI-generated images

As stated in the [RMIT Easy Cite Chicago guides](https://www.lib.rmit.edu.au/easy-cite/?styleguide=styleguide-4#stn-7#subtype-31), visual materials used in assessment tasks do not need the copyright permissions that are required for publishing or commercial use. However, it is essential that you give credit to the creator of the work and reference it in your work.

**Chicago A (Notes-Bibliography)**

**How to reference an image that you produce using an AI tool:**

Follow the [caption rules for your own work](https://www.lib.rmit.edu.au/easy-cite/?styleguide=styleguide-4#stn-7#subtype-32). Include the AI tool that was used as well as the prompt.

**Caption**

##### Rule

> Figure number. Description or explanation.

##### Example

> ![Two students studying in a park](images/Firefly-two-students-studying-in-a-park-in-the-sunshine-16158.webp)<br>
> Figure 1. Artwork created using Adobe Firefly in response to the prompt: two students studying in a park in the sunshine.


**How to reference an AI-generated image reproduced from a published source:**

Follow the general guidelines for [Art or creative works](https://www.lib.rmit.edu.au/easy-cite/?styleguide==styleguide-4#stn-7#subtype-33), noting that the [Chicago Manual of Style](https://go.openathens.net/redirector/rmit.edu.au?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.chicagomanualofstyle.org%2Fbook%2Fed17%2Fpart3%2Fch14%2Fpsec235.html) states that information about images and works of art can usually be presented in the text, rather than a note or bibliography. A caption below the image can be used to include the necessary information. Use the name of the human as the creator (if known) and include information that the work was generated using AI - we recommend adding this information in the medium field. If the human creator of the image is unknown, use text such as Artwork created using (the AI tool) in place of the creator's name.

**Caption**

##### Rule

> Figure number. Artist’s Given Name Artist’s Family Name, *Title of work* (if known), Year of production (if known). Medium, in Author's Given Name and Family Names, source details (e.g. website, book, etc). 

##### Examples

> Figure 1: Jason Allen, *Théâtre D’opéra Spatial*, 2022. Artwork created using Midjourney, in Kevin Roose, "An A.I.-Generated Picture Won an Art Prize. Artists Aren’t Happy." *The New York Times*, September 2, 2022, https<nolink>://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/02/technology/ai-artificial-intelligence-artists.html.
