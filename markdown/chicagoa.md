**Important: this is a guide only.** To avoid losing marks:

- Confirm referencing requirements with your lecturer.

- Use The Chicago Manual of Style. 17th ed. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2017 to clarify referencing rules or if you need more examples. This guide is based on <a href="https://rmit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/61RMIT_INST/1adn3cm/alma9921991311601341" target="_blank">The Chicago manual of style. 17th edition.</a> (opens in a new tab).

There are two formats of referencing within the Chicago Style. One is **notes and bibliography** (Chicago A) and the other is **author-date** style (Chicago B). This guide provides examples and advice for **notes and bibliography only**. Notes and bibliography uses a numerical system of footnotes or endnotes. Footnotes require the writer to mark the in-text citation with a superscript number and provide a reference citation within the footnote. Throughout the document, citations are numbered in sequential order. A bibliography should be included at the end of the document, preferably in alphabetical order.

**Footnotes/ Endnotes** : Footnotes or endnotes are numbered and correspond to note reference numbers in the text.

**Bibliography** : A bibliography is the term used for a list of resources consulted (e.g. books, articles, websites) when writing an assignment.

For examples and advice regarding **author-date style** of Chicago, please see [RMIT Easy Cite referencing tool - Chicago B: Author-Date 17th ed.](index.php?styleguide=styleguide-5#stn-0).

### General rules for notes - footnotes and endnotes

###### start-subtype-content

Always check with your tutor or lecturer about any specific requirements they have around referencing.

Look at the example documents to view footnotes and endnotes in Microsoft Word.

- <a href="https://rmit.libguides.com/ld.php?content_id=49642286" target="_blank">Sample essay - footnotes</a> (downloads a document)

- <a href="https://rmit.libguides.com/ld.php?content_id=49642290" target="_blank">Sample essay - endnotes</a> (downloads a document)

#### Notes - Footnotes or Endnotes

- Each time you paraphrase, summarise, or use a direct quote in your paper, include a note to cite your source. A note can be a footnote or an endnote.

- A note number should be placed at the end of a sentence or clause, and after the punctuation.

- Footnotes can be found at the bottom of each page, i.e. in the footer, whereas endnotes are placed at the end of the document, chapter or section of writing.

- Notes require you to mark all in-text citations with a superscript number and provide a citation in the note. Notes should be numbered in sequential order.

- Previous editions of the Chicago Manual of Style recommended the use of *ibid.* (from *ibidem*, “in the same place”) when repeating a citation in footnotes. Unlike previous editions, the 17th ed. of the Chicago Manual of Style discourages the use of *ibid.* in favour of shortened citations.

- Chicago does not require you to include an access date unless no date of publication or revision can be determined from the source. However, you may wish to check with your lecturer first as they may have a preference for including access dates.

- The first line of your note should be indented .5" from the left of the page, or 5 spaces.

Example;

> {.footnote-indent}1. Doug Patt, *How to Architect* (Cambridge, Mass: MIT Press. 2012), 28.{/.footnote-indent}

**When do I use a shortened note?**

The first time you cite a source in a note, include all the recommended citation information. If you cite that same source again, use a shortened note.

- Author full-names are shortened to Family Name.

- Titles are shortened if longer than four words.

- Include the relevant page numbers.

- Include a note number.

- Ensure that the first line of your note is .5" from the left of the page, or 5 spaces.

Example;

> {.footnote-indent}2. Patt, *How to Architect,* 35.{/.footnote-indent}

#### Shortening a title

- The order of words should not be changed.

- Initial articles like “the” or “a” may be removed.

- Key words from the original title should be retained.

- Ensure the first part of the short citation matches what is listed in the bibliography.

- A short title is italicised or placed in "quotation marks" based on the full title.

#### Block quotations

- Block quotations should be used for quotes longer than five lines.

- Do not use quotation marks for block quotations.

- Block quotations are indented from the left (and sometimes from the right also).

- Block quotations require their own footnote.

- Quotation marks can be used within a block quotation when including a separate quote within the text.

#### Create a footnote in Word

1. Place your curser at the end of the sentence, after the punctuation.

2. Click ***References***.

3. Select ***Insert Footnote***.

4. A superscript number will appear in your text.

5. In the footer, place your footnote. Remember that you will need to indent the first line of the footnote by 5 spaces.

### General rules for bibliography

###### start-subtype-content

#### Basic rules to create a bibliography

- A bibliography includes all sources cited within the text, as well as any additional sources consulted.

- Place the bibliography at the end of your work on a new page.

- Title the page, *Bibliography,* and centre the title.

- Arrange the list of works in alphabetical order according to the family name of the author or editor.

- Author's names are inverted for the bibliography - Family Name, Given Name.

- Capitalise all titles.

- If the author is unknown, begin the reference with the title of work.

#### Create a hanging indent using Microsoft Word

The second line of each bibliography entry has a hanging indent.

##### To create a hanging indent in Microsoft Word;

1.  Highlight all text (Shift + A).

2.  Right click (Shift + F10).

3.  Select ***paragraph***.

4.  Under the heading, ***Indentation**,* select the drop-down box for ***Special*** and select ***Hanging***.

As social media content is usually untitled, use the text of the post itself (up to 160 characters) in place of a title.

If an author's screen-name is available, include it in parentheses after their name. If only the screen-name is known, use that instead of the author's name.

Include the name of the social media site, and if relevant, include the type of post (photo, video) as in the Twitter example below.

To find a direct URL for a Facebook post, use the search function on the Facebook page to find the post and then copy the URL.

### General guidelines for visual materials

<!-- first accordion item -->
###### start-subtype-content

Visual materials can include illustrations, photographs, images, paintings, diagrams, maps and graphs.

Visual materials that you use in your assignment or for study purposes do not need the copyright permissions that are required for publishing or commercial use. However, it is essential that you give credit to the creator of the work and reference it in your work. This can be done using a caption or a note.

Citations are also influenced by the location of where you found the image or creative work. Where possible, cite the original rather than a reproduction.

Visual materials from books, articles and other sources that you refer to but don’t reproduce should be cited in the standard format of the source as described in the other sections of this guide.

Visual materials are not usually included in a bibliography. Some courses might request a list of illustrations or figures.

Your lecturer may have specific requirements for referencing illustrations and artworks. Any directions given by your lecturer must be followed, even if they differ from this guide.

###### start-subtype-item

### Captions

###### start-subtype-content

#### Using Captions

Captions are used to provide a description of illustrations, images and artworks. These are usually placed below the illustration.

A figure number is used in the caption to identify each illustration. These figures are numbered sequentially in the order in which they appear.

Illustrations you create of your own work are not usually referenced. However, a caption such as “Figure 7. Photograph by author” or “Figure 11. Initial sketches” might be appropriate when other illustrations in your assignment are referenced.

Make sure you refer to the figure in your writing and include the figure number. The word figure is always written in full and lower case, except when in parentheses when it is abbreviated (fig. 1).

#### Caption rule (Own work)

Figure number. Description or explanation.

##### Caption example

> {.figure-text}Figure 1. Author’s photograph showing design development.{/.figure-text}

#### Caption rule (reproduced artwork)

Figure number. Artist’s Given Name Artist’s Family Name, *Title of work*, Year produced. Medium. Source - Publishing details of where you found it.
