<!-- first accordion item -->
###### start-subtype-content

The AGLC4 (Australian Guide to Legal Citation 4th edition) is the official legal citation guide in Australia and is widely used by legal practitioners, law students and academics. The AGLC4 is the required referencing style for students enrolled in law programs within RMIT’s Graduate School of Business and Law.

The AGLC4 is a **footnote** referencing style. **Superscript numbers** <sup>1,3,6</sup> represent in-text citations, and the details are included in a **footnote** at the end of each page. Where a bibliography is required, it should list all the citations used and other sources that were relied upon, organised **alphabetically** in sections and placed at the end of your document.

The AGLC4 style is a collaboration between the *Melbourne University Law Review* and the *Melbourne Journal of International Law*. The official AGLC4 publication, which this guide is based on, is freely available to view and download from the <a href="https://law.unimelb.edu.au/mulr/aglc/about">publisher’s website</a> (click on *Download the view-only PDF version* option).

**Important:** this is a guide only. To avoid losing marks, confirm referencing requirements with your educators.

### General principles

###### start-subtype-content

The AGLC4 style consists of:

-	Footnotes to provide information about sources used in your work.

-	Within the text of your work, footnote numbers (using a superscript) are positioned after punctuation.

-	Footnotes appear at the end of each page of your work.

-	Use a full stop at the end of each footnote.

-	Separate multiple sources in a footnote with a semicolon (;).

-	A **Pinpoint** is the particular page, paragraph or chapter number from which you have sourced information.

-	The first time a source is cited, it is cited in full. Thereafter, it is appropriate to use either '**ibid**' or '**n**'. See AGLC section 1.4.

-	If a bibliography is required it should be provided at the end of the paper. Give details of each source mentioned in the text, as well as details of other sources consulted in preparing the paper.

**In-text example**

>  Recent developments in Australian law following the decision of the High Court in *IceTV Pty Ltd v Network Nine Australia Pty Ltd* illustrate a fundamental shift in the approach of courts regarding the importance and form of authorship.<sup>1</sup>

**Footnote example**

>  <sup>1</sup> *IceTV Pty Ltd v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd* [2009] HCA 14.

#### Pinpoint references

A pinpoint reference within a footnote directs the reader to a particular place in the cited work:

-	For sources such as cases, books or journal articles, a pinpoint reference might refer the reader to a particular chapter, page or paragraph.

-	For legislative materials, pinpoint references can also refer to parts, sections, clauses or divisions.

-	A pinpoint reference is provided at the end of the footnote.

See section 3.1.4 of the <a href="https://www.mulr.com.au/aglc/AGLC4-2021-v1.pdf">AGLC4</a> (opens in a new tab)  for a full list of abbreviations used in pinpoint references for legislative materials.

#### Repeat citations

When a source is cited more than once in a paper the full bibliographic details should only be provided in the first instance.

The terms '**Ibid**' and '**n**' are used for repeat citations of the same work. In some circumstances, '**above (n)**' or '**below (n)**' are used to direct the reader to a specific part or reference within a text.

**Using 'Ibid'**

Use 'Ibid' in a footnote where the immediately preceding footnote refers to the same work. The exception to this rule is if a footnote lists more than one source (in this case use 'n').
If a footnote refers to the same work and to the same pinpoint reference, simply use 'Ibid'. The pinpoint reference does not need to be repeated in this case.
If a footnote refers to the same work but to a different pinpoint reference, use 'Ibid' followed by the pinpoint reference.

> <sup>1</sup> *IceTV Pty Ltd v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd* [2009] HCA 14.<br>
> <sup>2</sup> Ibid. <br>
> <sup>3</sup> Ibid HCA 15-16.

**Using 'n'**

Use ‘n’ to refer to a source that has been cited in a previous footnote other than the immediately preceding one.

If citing a source that has already been referred to then a shortened form of the citation should be provided (e.g. shortened author name or title), along with the footnote number **(n)** in parentheses. Also include the pinpoint if different from the first citation.

> <sup>1</sup> *IceTV Pty Ltd v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd* [2009] HCA 14.<br>
> ...<br>
> <sup>4</sup> *IceTV* (n 1) HCA 17.

Note: If referring to a specific part/s or reference/s within a text then use 'above (n)' or 'below (n)' where appropriate. See AGLC section 1.4.2 for further details.

> <sup>5</sup> See above n 1 and accompanying text.<br>
> <sup>6</sup> See below n 7 Part II(A).

### General rules for the bibliography

###### start-subtype-content

If a bibliography is required list all works referred to both in footnotes and in the body of your assignment, as well as all works consulted in writing your assignment.

The bibliography is divided into sections as outlined in AGLC 1.13:

A. *Articles/Books/Reports*

B. *Cases*

C. *Legislation*

D. *Treaties*

E. *Other*

Note: Organise items alphabetically under each heading.

Note that details provided in the bibliography are almost identical to details provided in the footnotes, with the following exceptions:

-	Invert the first author’s first name and family name and separate these with a comma.

-	Pinpoint references are not included; however, note that the starting page number for journal articles and cases is **not** a pinpoint and remains part of the citation.

-	There is **no** full stop at the end of a bibliography entry.

### Articles published in online journals

###### start-subtype-content

- Online journal articles should be cited in the same way as printed articles wherever possible. If volume, issue or starting page numbers are not available, use other identifiers such as article numbers.

- Pinpoint references should appear after the article number/identifier, preceded by a comma, and a space. The article number/identifier should appear as it does in the source.

- Journal articles that have a volume and issue number have page ranges (start and end pages) that are numbered sequentially throughout the entire issue (e.g. 70-84, 85-102, 103-115).

- If the online journal article, which could be a PDF or other digital document, has no volume and issue number, the article has a page range that typically starts at 1 and ends on the last page (e.g. 1-12). There is no issue sequential page numbering. In such cases, pinpoints should refer to a position (actual page number) within the page range (e.g. 7).

### Student's own work

###### start-subtype-content

You should include the use of scholarly sources in your written assessments to adhere to best academic integrity practice. Citing yourself as an authority on your own opinion should be avoided.

Note: Check first with your lecturer, or teacher, if it is permissible to cite your previously submitted work.

Remember that when submitting work, you will be asked to agree to the <a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/students/student-essentials/assessment-and-exams/assessment/assessment-declaration">Assessment Declaration</a> (opens in a new tab).

The publication, *Australian Guide to Legal Citation* (4<sup>th</sup> ed, 2018) does not provide guidelines on how to cite your own work. The following examples show how to cite your own work that you have previously submitted for assessment.

If you cite or quote your own previous work, treat yourself as the author and the title of your previous assessment as an unpublished paper.

Note: If your original work contained citations from other sources, you would need to include those same citations in the new work as well.

Include the following details:

- Student name

- 'Title of previous work'

- Unpublished paper

- University

- Month Year

#### Footnote example

For example, if Geoffrey Smith wanted to cite a paper they wrote at RMIT University in 2019, their footnote reference may look like this:

> <sup>1</sup> Geoffrey Smith, 'Australia's copyright law reforms' (unpublished paper, RMIT University, October 2019).

#### Pinpoint example

> <sup>1</sup> Geoffrey Smith, 'Australia's copyright law reforms' (unpublished paper, RMIT University, October 2019) 5.

#### Bibliography example

> Smith, Geoffrey, 'Australia's copyright law reforms' (unpublished paper, RMIT University, October 2019)

When acknowledging sources created by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, it is recommended that the Nation/Country/Language Group is included after the author’s or creator’s name. This is based on guidance from the <a href="https://www.caval.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/CAVAL_Indigenous_Knowledges_Citation_Guide.pdf">Indigenous Referencing Guidance for Indigenous Knowledges</a> published in 2023 by the Indigenous Archives Collective.

The guidelines licensed under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">CC-BY-NC-SA</a> licence allows reusers to distribute, remix, adapt, and build upon the material in any medium or format for non-commercial purposes only, and only so long as attribution is given to the creator. This license also applies to this guide.

It is advised to attribute a Nation/Country/language group to an author who has self-identified. This information can be located, for example, in a biographical note to an article or on a personal website.

### Using AI-generated content

<!-- first accordion item -->
###### start-subtype-content

**Please note** that the guidelines on how to reference AI tools have been updated in February 2026. 

#### Using generative artificial intelligence (AI) in learning and research, including assessment tasks
The educators within your courses can tell you if you are able to use artificial intelligence (AI) tools in your assessment tasks, including how you can use the tools and what tools you can use. If you use any AI tools, you must appropriately acknowledge and reference the use of these tools and their outputs. Failure to reference the use of these tools can result in academic misconduct.

**Please confirm with your course educator** before using any AI tools in your assessment tasks.

#### Current Australian copyright law relating to AI-generated content
The Australian Copyright Act does not explicitly mention AI-generated content; however the Act can give some guidance as to what copyright protects and how copyright is infringed.
Copyright protection in Australia is free and automatic as soon as content is in a material form (e.g. a text is written, a song is recorded or an artwork is painted). It does not need to be registered, applied for or paid for. 
To be protected content must be original and be made by a human author. If a work is not created by a human author, it is not protected by copyright.
A work created solely by AI is not created by a human and does not qualify for Copyright protection in Australia.
Due to the prompts and training data, it can be unclear who owns the copyright in outputs from generative AI tools.
For more information, see the RMIT Copyright library guide.

### Acknowledging the use of AI tools

In some assessment tasks, you may be able to use AI tools for background research, to generate an outline for your essay or report, or to get feedback on your writing and structure. In such cases, you are using AI tools in the process of creating the work but you are not included AI-generated content in your final work. For this type of AI use, you need to include an acknowledgement of what AI tools were used and how they were used within the body or methods section of your work. If you include any AI-generated outputs in your work (including text, images or code) you need to include a citation and a reference - see the referencing guidelines below for more details.

The advice below is based on the current (September 2025) advice from the APA 7th style manual editors, as the other style manual editors do not provide specific advice for acknowledging the use of AI tools. 

In your acknowledgement, include the following:
How you used the AI tool, the name of the AI tool and the creator.

In your bibliography, include an entry for the AI tool (see the citing and referencing AI-generated content for this format).

**Format for the acknowledgement:**

I used [tool used] (Creator, year) to [explain how tool was used] 

**Example acknowledgements:**

I used ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2026) to provide topic suggestions for my research project.

I used the Writing Help persona in Val (RMIT, 2026) to provide feedback on my assignment draft.


### Citing and referencing AI-generated content

The Australian Guide to Legal Citation (AGLC), 4th edition guide does not contain any guidelines for referencing AI-generated content, and the style guide does not include guidelines for referencing software. According to the University of Western Australia Library <sup>1</sup>, the editors of Melbourne University Law Review (the creators of the AGLC4 guide) recommend the following as interim advice:

AI-generated content should be referenced as Written Correspondence (as per Rule 7.12). 
Discursive text (e.g. explanations) may be included in the footnote (see Rule 1.1.5 for further information on Discursive Text). 
An Appendix may be included to provide comprehensive information about the prompts and outputs.
You may be required to produce any prompts and outputs. Please ensure that you save all prompts and outputs so that you can access them if needed.
Include both the company name and the AI tool name in the footnote and bibliography entry.

**Footnote template and example - shareable URL:**

1  Output from [tool name], [company name] to [your name], [full date] <shareable URL (if available)>.

1  Output from ChatGPT, OpenAI to Mike Smith, 28 January 2026 <https://chatgpt.com/share/123456789123456789>.

**Footnote example with discursive text - appendix:**

2  Output from Val, RMIT to Mike Smith, 27 January 2026. The output was generated in response to the prompt, 'Explain the history of Hansard': see Appendix A.

**Bibliography template:**

[Tool name], [Company name] to [your name], Output, (full date) <shareable URL (if available)>

**Bibliography examples:**

OpenAI, ChatGPT to Mike Smith, Output, 28 January 2026 <https://chatgpt.com/share/123456789123456789>

RMIT, Val to Mike Smith, Output, 27 January 2026

### AI-generated images

The AGLC4 does not provide specific guidance on AI-generated images. The advice below is based on the guidance from the University of Western Australia Library <sup>1</sup>.

**AI-generated images that you have created:**

AI-generated images don't need to include a footnote. Include the image in your work with a figure number and caption stating that the image was generated using an AI tool, along with the prompt used.  

**Caption template:**

Figure number: Description.

**Example:**

![law student at university](images/Firefly-a-law-student-at-university-648.webp)<br>
Figure 1: Image generated using Adobe Firefly from the prompt 'a law student at university'.

**AI-generated images from published sources:**

Include the image with a figure number and a caption. In the caption, include a description of the image as well as a note number. Include a corresponding footnote with details of the publication and include the publication in the bibliography.
