###### start-subtype-content

The IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) referencing style is often used in electrical and electronic engineering, computer science and other technical fields. This IEEE guide is based on the *IEEE Reference Guide* that is freely available to view and download from the <a href="https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/your-role-in-article-production/ieee-editorial-style-manual/">publisher's website</a>.

The IEEE style is a **numerical** or **numbered** system. It requires that sources are acknowledged as an in-text citation by **numbering** them **consecutively** in the order in which they **first appear** in the body of work. For example, the first source is given number 1, the second source number 2, and so on. Each source is allocated a unique number. Once you give a source a number, the same number is used for the in-text citation whenever you refer to that source in the body of work. In the reference list at the end of your document, the source’s number appears in **numerical** order. 

**Important:** this is a guide only. To avoid losing marks, confirm referencing requirements with your educators.

### General rules for in-text citations

###### start-subtype-content

- In your writing, you must acknowledge each author or source of information (whether print or online) either by **paraphrasing** or using a direct quote.

- References that are cited in-text must appear as a number within square brackets, and need to come before any punctuation with a space before the bracket [1].

- Numbered references used in-text start at [1] and continue in **ascending** order within the body of the work.
Once a source has been cited and allocated a reference number, the same reference number must be used throughout the body of a work if it’s referred to multiple times.

- List all multiple citations in ascending numerical order enclosing each citation number in brackets, e.g. [1], [5], [6], [7], [11] or as [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. Do not use an en dash.

- Numbered citations may be treated grammatically as footnote numbers in the text e.g. As demonstrated by Smith [5] . . . OR, For further details, see [1], [5], [7].

- Numbered citations may also be treated as nouns in the text e.g. According to [7] . . . OR, As mentioned in [4], [5], [6]-[8].

- It is **not** necessary to mention either the author(s) or dates of any work cited in-text.

- When citing in text, for **one to two** authors, include both author’s family names. When there are **three or more** authors, cite the first family name, followed by **et al.**

- When directly quoting, that is using the exact words that an author has used, enclose the quote in double quotation marks “ ” and allocate a citation number along with the page number(s) in square brackets [2, p.44].

- In your writing, **acronyms** should be written out in full the first time referred to, followed by the acronym in parentheses. For subsequent occurrences, the use of the acronym is acceptable. See the **Abbreviations** section for more details.

#### Paraphrasing
Paraphrasing is when you express the ideas of the author(s) in your own words. When paraphrasing, it’s acceptable to include only the citation as a number in square brackets, or as a number along with the author’s family name as part of your sentence.

*Note: When paraphrasing, the citation details can be placed at the beginning, middle or end of a sentence.*

#### Citation at the beginning

> Benson [1] states that thermal performance . . .

#### Citation in the middle

> . . . not only does the shift toward multicore processors mean more improvements in CPU speed [1], but they also consume less power and produce less heat.

#### Citation at the end

> . . . and therefore the rate of heat transfer slows [1].

*Note: Citations can also be structured according to whether they give prominence to the author, or to the information being conveyed.*

#### Author-prominent citations

> In his research on software thermal management, Benson [1] claims that . . .

#### Information-prominent citations

> . . . where more processors are being produced to optimise power and thermal performance [1].

#### Including page numbers in a paraphrase citation

When paraphrasing, page numbers are not usually used as part of the citation, unless it intends to help the reader to locate the source of the information in a lengthy or complex document.

*Note: Including page numbers when paraphrasing is optional, and is not a requirement of the IEEE referencing style.*

#### Direct quotes

Direct quotes are used when you are using the exact words of the author(s). Put direct quotes between double quotation marks “ ” and add both the citation number followed by a comma, and the page number(s), preceded by **p**. (for a single page) or **pp**. (for multiple pages). **Do not overuse direct quotes!**

> "Due to the nonlinear nature of the Law of Dynamic Power, if the demand on the processor is light, the operating frequency can be reduced to save clock cycles, reducing power and limiting heat generation" [1, p. 82].

#### Citing a source with no page number(s)

If the work you are referencing does not contain page numbers, then use chapter numbers, section headings and paragraph numbers as part of the in-text reference.

> "Many physical dynamic systems can be represented and modeled by first-order differential equations" [1, Ch. 3, para. 1].

#### Omitting words from a direct quote

If you omit words from a direct quote, you will need to add a space followed by three ellipsis dots ( . . . ) and another space.

> "The third basic electrical element is the inductor . . . Generally, the induced voltage v in an inductor is proportional to the rate of change of current i" [1, p. 168].

*Note: Quotes longer than **three lines** are strongly discouraged, and should be avoided.*

### Citing the same reference multiple times

###### start-subtype-content

If citing the same reference within the body of the text, then use the same citation number throughout the text. IEEE does **not** allow for the use of terms such as “ibid.” or “op. cit.” when citing the same reference multiple times. Instead, if the same source is cited multiple times, then it is preferable to distinguish between these with reference to the appropriate section, for example:

- [1, p. 15] when directly quoting a single page

- [1, pp. 29–31] directly quoting multiple pages

- [1, Ch. 8] referring to a chapter

- [1, Tab. 12] a table


###### end-subtype-content

###### end-subtype-item



###### start-subtype-item

### Multiple citations

###### start-subtype-content

If listing multiple citations within a sentence of text, list each citation number separately within square brackets and with a comma between each citation. 

List all **multiple citations** in ascending numerical order e.g. [1], [6], [9]. Or [5], [6], [7], [8].

> In [1], [4], [8] it was noted that . . .

> It is suggested by [6], [7], [8], [9] that . . .


###### end-subtype-content

###### end-subtype-item



###### start-subtype-item

### Secondary citations

###### start-subtype-content

A secondary citation is used when you acknowledge the work of an author that you have read about in another author’s work.

The IEEE referencing style does **not** allow for the use of secondary citations.

If a secondary citation has to be used, then the original source must be located and cited.

If the original source cannot be located, then do **not** cite it.

###### end-subtype-content

###### end-subtype-item



###### start-subtype-item

### Abbreviations

###### start-subtype-content

#### Abbreviations - Months

When citing journals, patents and websites, use the following abbreviations for months:

> Jan., Feb., Mar., Apr., May, Jun., July, Aug., Sept., Oct., Nov., and Dec. (*note that the month of May appears in full and does not require a full stop*).

Use a *forward slash* for bimonthly issues e.g. Apr./May 2016 and a en dash for a quarterly issue e.g. Jun–Aug. 2015.

#### All other abbreviations

For all abbreviations, including for words, journal titles, magazine titles, conferencing proceedings, and publishers, see Section IV for **Useful Abbreviations in References** section of the <a href="https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/IEEE_Reference_Guide.pdf">IEEE Reference Guide (2022)</a> (opens in a new tab) pp. 20–24.

#### Acronyms in-text

Acronyms are to be defined in-text and written out **in full the first time referred to**, followed by the acronym in parentheses.

> The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) [1] Space Flight report identifies . . .

For subsequent occurrences the use of the acronym is acceptable.

> The NASA [1] report also outlines . . .

#### Acronyms in the reference list

Acronyms in the reference list are to be written out in full for **corporate/organisation author names**. However, **publisher names** can be abbreviated or an acronym can be used.

> {.ieee-refs}[1] &nbsp; National Aeronautics and Space Administration, “Space flight: the first 30 years,” NASA, Washington, DC, USA, Rep. 1, 1991. {/.ieee-refs}

### General rules for the reference list

###### start-subtype-content

#### General rules

- Use a reference list to include all of the publications you have acknowledged at the end of your work, and use the heading **References** or **Reference List** on a new page.

- The reference list is arranged in an ascending numbered sequence such as [1], [2], [3] and so on, and must be presented in the order in which they appear in the body of the text.

- Reference list numbers should be positioned flush against the left page margin, and the citation details must appear on the same line, and be indented.

- IEEE requires some words, months, publisher names, conference proceedings and journal titles to be abbreviated where appropriate – see **Abbreviations** section for further details.

- **Publisher names** in the reference list can be abbreviated or an acronym can be used e.g. WHO may be used instead of World Health Organization.

- Do not abbreviate or use acronyms for **corporate/organisation author names** e.g. CSIRO should be written out as Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in the reference list.

- Capitalise and italicise titles where appropriate.

- Do not combine references – only one reference per number. See **Example of a reference list** section for formatting details.

- Include a retrieval statement in the form of a DOI or URL (where possible) if the reference is taken from an electronic or online source, or alternatively, where stated in the rules, a database name. The DOI can be added to the reference list using the following formats: doi:xx.xxxxxxxxxxxx or http<nolink>://doi:xx.xxxxxxxxxxxxx. There is **no** full stop after a URL, but there is after a DOI. Neither the DOI or URL should be hyperlinked.

- Take care when editing any references, as this may require careful renumbering of sources cited both in-text and in the reference list.

- The Reference List is to be formatted using 1.5 line spacing and single paragraph spacing between each citation. For clarification see your lecturer.
  
- For the place of publication, add the city, and then include the state abbreviation (if applicable) and country name, followed by the publisher and year of publication. Cities in the USA need the city name, state abbreviation and country abbreviation.

### Student's own work

###### start-subtype-content

You should include the use of scholarly sources in your written assessments to adhere to best academic integrity practice. Citing yourself as an authority on your own opinion should be avoided.

Note: Check first with your lecturer, or teacher, if it is permissible to cite your previously submitted work.

Remember that when submitting work, you will be asked to agree to the <a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/students/student-essentials/assessment-and-exams/assessment/assessment-declaration">Assessment Declaration</a> (opens in a new tab).

The publication, IEEE Reference Guide (2020) does not provide guidelines on how to cite your own work. The following examples show how to cite your own work that you have previously submitted for assessment.

If you cite or quote your own previous work, treat yourself as the author and the title of your previous assessment as an unpublished paper.

#### Paraphrasing in-text

When paraphrasing, include the citation number in square brackets. Or, if referring to your family name in the body of the text, then include the citation number in square brackets immediately after your family name.

For example, if Brad Smith wanted to cite a paper they wrote at RMIT University in 2019, their in-text reference may look like this:

> Studies indicate that . . . [9].

> Smith [9] noted that . . .

If your original work contained citations from other sources, you would need to include those same citations in the new work as well.

For example, if Brad Smith's earlier paper had cited Nisbet and Rostow, for example, it may look like this:

> According to Smith [9], Nisbet and Rostow [18] argue . . .

#### Direct quote in-text

Place direct quotes between double quotation marks " " and provide the page number from the previous work.

> "There are three forms of linear graphs: point-slope, standard and slope-intercept" [9, p. 3].

#### Reference list

In the Reference list include:

- Student name

- "Title of previous work"

- Unpublished

- Month and year

##### Using generative artificial intelligence (AI) in learning and research, includinng assessment tasks

The educators within your courses can tell you if you are able to use artificial intelligence (AI) tools in your assessment tasks, including how you can use the tools and what tools you can use. If you use any AI tools, you must appropriately acknowledge and reference the use of these tools and their outputs. Failure to reference the use of these tools can result in academic misconduct.

**Please confirm with your course educator** before using any AI tools in your assessment tasks. 

#### Overview of text-generating AI tools

**Introduction to AI tools that can generate text**

AI tools that generate text, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, are large language models with a conversational type of interface, where you can ask a question, receive a detailed response and follow up with additional queries.

Some generative AI tools are not connected to the internet and are trained on data sets up to a specific time point. Other generative AI tools connect to the internet and will provide URL links to information. There are some points to consider when using the text generated by these tools:

- As these tools function in a similar way to predictive text on your phone, by recognising and reproducing patterns in language, they can generate incorrect information.
- While they can produce citations and references, these are not always correct. If you are relying on the information to be accurate, you should check that the reference cited by the AI tool exists, and that the information cited is present in the original source.
- The data sets used to train these tools often include biased and inaccurate information, as access to scholarly information and valid scientific studies may be limited, and information from social media and other less reputable sources is included.

The [Learning Lab Artificial Intelligence Tools module](https://learninglab.rmit.edu.au/university-essentials/artificial-intelligence-tools/) has more information on how these AI tools work, and some points to consider when using them. 

**Copyright and non-human authors**

Current copyright law only recognises humans as authors and creators. One of the moral rights associated with copyright is the right to be acknowledged as the author of a work. From a copyright perspective an AI tool cannot be [recognised as the creator of a work](https://www.artslaw.com.au/information-sheet/artificial-intelligence-ai-and-copyright/), however it is important to explain that an AI tool was used in the creation of the work. This has informed our referencing guidance.

**General acknowledgement that AI tools have been used in the creation of a work**

In some assessment tasks, you may be able to use AI tools for background research, or to generate an outline for your essay or report (as stated earlier, please follow your educator's guidance before using any AI tools).. In this case, rather than citing and referencing specific text generated by AI tools, you will need to provide a general acknowledgement within the body or methods section of your text to explain that an AI tool was used in the creation of your work. Include as much detail as possible, including how you used the AI tool, the prompt used, the date you used the tool, and the name, creator and version of the AI tool.  

Example: On the 26th June 2023, I used the May 24 version of OpenAI's ChatGPT to perform background research by using the following prompt "explain the difference between deep learning and machine learning". 

**Referencing specific text content generated by AI tools**

Each of the referencing styles used at RMIT is based on a source style manual. More information on the source style manuals used for each style can be found in [Easy Cite](https://www.lib.rmit.edu.au/easy-cite/). Currently, only the editors of the APA  style manual have provided advice on referencing AI-generated content. For the other referencing styles used at RMIT, we have created interim guidelines for referencing AI-generated content that we believe are the best match within that style. These may change in the future as the source style manuals develop or update their guidelines for referencing AI-generated content.  

If you are referring to content generated by AI tools within your work, we recommend that you include the shareable link to the content if available, or otherwise include this AI-generated content as an appendix or supplemental information. It is also good practice to include the question or prompt that generated the response to provide context for your readers. 

Two sets of reference guidelines are provided below for each style - one is for AI tools that include shareable URLs to the outputs generated from text prompts, which enables your readers to access the outputs themselves.  The other is for AI tools that do not provide shareable links, meaning that the readers of your work cannot access the same information themselves. 


#### AI-generated images

Your course lecturer can tell you if you are able to use content generated by artificial intelligence (AI) tools in your assessment tasks, including AI-generated images. **Please confirm with your course lecturer** for a specific assessment task before using any AI tools.

If you are able to use AI tools in your assessment task, you need to appropriately acknowledge and reference all of the AI-generated content that you include. Failure to reference this AI-generated content can result in [academic misconduct](https://www.rmit.edu.au/students/my-course/assessment-results/academic-integrity).

**Please note** that the information about using generative AI tools will continue to be updated - we recommend checking this guide regularly and confirming with your course lecturer if you are unsure.


##### Overview of images generated by AI tools


Some generative AI tools have been trained on large numbers of existing images, and these tools can create new images based on prompts from users. The images created using these tools can be downloaded, but they are not published or reproducible in the AI platform. Images generated using AI tools such as Midjourney and DALL-E 2 are the topic of much debate.  Current copyright law only recognises humans as authors. One of the moral rights associated with copyright is the right to be acknowledged as the author of a work. From a copyright perspective there is currently no obligation to [recognise AI as the creator of a work](https://www.artslaw.com.au/information-sheet/artificial-intelligence-ai-and-copyright/), however it is important to explain that AI was used in the creation of the work.  

AI-generated images are an emerging technology, and there are not yet clear guidelines for how to incorporate them into existing referencing styles such as APA 7th, Chicago, etc. Our current recommendation for how to reference AI-generated images varies for each referencing style. Additionally, we recommend that you include the question or prompt that generated the image where possible, to provide context for your readers.

**Please note** that our recommendations for how to reference AI-generated content may change in the future as referencing style manuals are updated.

### Referencing guidelines for AI-generated content

###### start-subtype-content

#### IEEE Interim guidelines

The IEEE referencing guide does not currently contain any guidelines for referencing AI-generated content, but the style guide does include guidelines for referencing software. We have adapted the software guidelines below, as we believe this is the best match for the style. Please note these are interim guidelines and these may be updated in the future when the IEEE style manual editors release formal advice.

The IEEE referencing style uses numbered in-text citations that match the corresponding reference list entry. 

Include details of the AI tool version if known. If a shareable URL to the content is available, include it in your reference list entry. If the content is not shareable, include the prompt used and the output generated in an appendix. Include the general URL for the tool and a note about the appendix in the reference list entry.

#### How to reference AI-generated images in IEEE
**How to reference images that you produce using an AI tool:**

Include the image in your work with a caption that explains that the work was generated using an AI tool, and what prompt was used.

##### Example

![A Typical Engineer](images/Firefly-a-typical-engineer-16158.webp)<br>

**Fig 1.** Image generated using Adobe Firefly from the prompt a typical engineer.

**How to reference AI-generated images reproduced in a published source:**

If using reproduced images, the IEEE style advice is to reference the published source, using a numbered in-text citation that matches the corresponding reference list entry. If including the AI-generated image in your work, include information and a numbered citation in the figure caption below the image.

**Caption**

##### Rule

> **Fig. number.** Description of figure [reference number]

##### Example

>**Fig 1.** A typical engineer as created by Stylianos Moschoglou using an AI machine learning model [1]

**Reference list entry:**
