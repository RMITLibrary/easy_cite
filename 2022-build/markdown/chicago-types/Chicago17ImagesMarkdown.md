### General Rules for Images

Chicago style uses the terminology 'illustrations' or 'figures' when including visual images presented separately from text sources.

'Figures' includes the following image types:

*   Charts or Graphs
*   Paintings, drawings, photographs, or other art works

When including reproduced images of diagrams, graphs, maps, photographs within your work, a caption provides a description or an explanation of the contents of the illustration. Captions are usually positioned below the illustration and include a figure number. See Captions section of this guide for further information.

When referring to an image in the text of your assignment, give a short citation consisting of the name of the artist/creator/author and the date.

Citations are also influenced by the location of where you found the image or creative work. Where possible, cite the original rather than a reproduction.

Visual images from books, articles, and other sources that you refer to but do not reproduce should be cited in the standard format of the source as described in the other sections of this guide.

Visual materials that you use in your assignment or for study purposes do not need the copyright permissions that are required for publishing or commercial use. However, it is essential that you give credit to the creator of the work and reference it in your work.

If you refer to any visual material, i.e. art, design or architecture, you have seen in person and you are not including an image of it in your document, provide a detailed in-text citation ie.(Georgia O'Keeffe, The Cliff Chimneys, 1938, Milwaukee Art Museum, Wisconsin)
