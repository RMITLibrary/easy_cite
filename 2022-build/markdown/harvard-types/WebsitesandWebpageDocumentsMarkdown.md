### Website / webpage

An entire website is only cited if you are referring to its content or purpose in general, or if you cannot link the information to a particular webpage.

For example, when referring to a website as a general resource in your assignment, you should link to that website homepage in the reference list. However, if you cite specific content from a particular webpage on the website, you need to identify the specific webpage in your reference list.

The author can be an individual person or organisation.

Include the author's name (individual or corporate), followed by publication year (e.g. 2021).

If a webpage does not have an author name (individual or organisation), use the title of the webpage in italics, followed by year of publication.

If the author's name is an organisation, you can use the shortened name form for your in-text references in parentheses if the organisation uses it regularly and it has become commonly accepted, e.g. 'WHO' rather than 'World Health Organization'. This saves you space. The full name is provided in the reference list.

#### In-text reference: Direct quotes

A direct quote is when you are using the exact words of the work. Put direct quotes between single inverted commas (quotation marks).

For direct quotes, page numbers are only required when they are provided in the original work. Websites or webpages, however, do not have page numbers. In this case, since no page number is available, you can indicate the location of the quote in your writing.

The examples below come from sources that do not have page numbers:

> COVID-19 and climate change have had such a huge impact on the world that they both 'have exacerbated malnutrition in all its forms and threatened the sustainability and resilience of food systems around the world' (WHO 2021).
> 
> Heath (2021) explains that artificial intelligence is seen as being 'tied to a system's ability to adapt and improvise in a new environment, to generalise its knowledge and apply it to unfamiliar scenarios'.

#### In-text reference: Paraphrasing

Paraphrasing is when you are expressing the ideas of the author(s) in your own words.

> Malnutrition, as well as the supply and provision of food worldwide, have worsened on account of COVID-19 and climate change (WHO 2021).

> Artificial intelligence can be defined as the capacity of a system to adapt to unfamiliar environments, forming generalisations in its knowledge and using that knowledge in new situations (Heath 2021).

#### Reference list entry

In your reference list:

- Enclose publication year (e.g. 2021) in brackets after author. If no publication year is supplied, write **n.d.** (for 'no date'). If the year can be reliably estimated or inferred from the site, then write **c.** (meaning 'circa' or approximately) followed by the year.

- If a website/webpage or downloadable webpage document (e.g. PDF) does not have an author name, start the reference with the title of the webpage or webpage document in italics, followed by year of publication.

- If the author's name is an organisation and you have used the abbreviated (shortened name) form in your in-text citations (e.g. WHO), include both the abbreviated (shortened name) form followed by the full version name in brackets, e.g. WHO (World Health Organization).

- If an organisation's name is **both** the author of the website/webpage **and** the name of the website/webpage, use the abbreviated (shortened) form for the name of the website/webpage. Do this even if you have not used the abbreviated (shortened) form in your writing before. This avoid repetition of long names, e.g. DET website.

- Reference specific webpages rather than a whole website; pinpoint the specific location of information.

- If you need to include the organisation's homepage in the reference list, and the homepage does not have a title, put the word **Homepage** instead of a title. Do not italicise, e.g. Telstra (n.d.), Homepage, Telstra, accessed 13 December 2021. https<nolink>://www.telstra.com.au/

- Include the word **website** after the name of the website. But if the name of the website is a URL (e.g. vic.gov.au), do not write the word **website**. Do not italicise the name of website.

- After website/webpage name, add the accessed date (e.g. accessed 13 December 2021) followed by a full stop, a space then the URL. No full stop after URL.

##### Rule

> Author's family name Initial or Organisation's Name (Year) *Title of webpage*, Name of Website website, accessed Day Month Year. URL

##### Examples

> Heath N (2021) *What is AI? Here's everything you need to know about artificial intelligence*, ZDNet website, accessed 9 December 2021. https<nolink>://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-ai-heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-artificial-intelligence/
> 
> WHO (World Health Organization) (2021) *WHO accelerates work on nutrition targets with new commitments*, WHO website, accessed 9 December 2021. https<nolink>://www.who.int/news/item/07-12-2021-who-accelerates-work-on-nutrition-targets-with-new-commitments

### Webpage document (PDF)

The author can be an individual person or organisation.

Include the author's name (individual or corporate), followed by publication year (e.g. 2021).

If a downloadable webpage document (e.g. PDF) does not have an author name (individual or organisation), use the title of the document in italics, followed by year of publication.

If the author's name is an organisation, you can use the shortened name form for your in-text references in parentheses if the organisation uses it regularly and it has become commonly accepted, e.g. 'WHO' rather than 'World Health Organization'. This saves you space. The full name is provided in the reference list.

#### In-text reference: Direct quotes

A direct quote is when you are using the exact words of the work. Put direct quotes between single inverted commas (quotation marks), and add a page number (if available).

For direct quotes, page numbers are only required when they are provided in the original work. After the year, put a colon (:) followed by the page number. If no page number is available, you can indicate the location of the quote in your writing.

The example below comes from a source that has a page number, i.e. 4:

> The Department of Education and Training, Victoria (2020:4) states that 'when teachers work together to improve their practice, students learn more'.

#### In-text reference: Paraphrasing

Paraphrasing is when you are expressing the ideas of the author(s) in your own words.

> Students' capacity to learn increases when teachers collaborate to improve their educational practices (Department of Education and Training, Victoria 2020).

#### Reference list entry

In your reference list:

- Enclose publication year (e.g. 2021) in brackets after author. If no publication year is supplied, write **n.d.** (for 'no date'). If the year can be reliably estimated or inferred from the site, then write **c.** (meaning 'circa' or approximately) followed by the year.

- If a website/webpage or downloadable webpage document (e.g. PDF) does not have an author name, start the reference with the title of the webpage or webpage document in italics, followed by year of publication.

- If the author's name is an organisation and you have used the abbreviated (shortened name) form in your in-text citations (e.g. WHO), include both the abbreviated (shortened name) form followed by the full version name in brackets, e.g. WHO (World Health Organization).

- If an organisation's name is **both** the author of the website/webpage **and** the name of the website/webpage, use the abbreviated (shortened) form for the name of the website/webpage. Do this even if you have not used the abbreviated (shortened) form in your writing before. This avoid repetition of long names, e.g. DET website.

- Include the word **website** after the name of the website. But if the name of the website is a URL (e.g. vic.gov.au), do not write the word **website**. Do not italicise the name of website.

- After website/webpage name, add the accessed date (e.g. accessed 13 December 2021) followed by a full stop, a space then the URL. No full stop after URL.

- For downloadable webpage documents (e.g. PDFs), do not provide a URL that directly links to the document. Instead, provide a URL that links to the landing page where the document is located. If there is no landing page, provide a URL that directly links to the document.
