 ### Introduction to Harvard

**Important: this is a guide only.** To avoid losing marks:

- Please confirm the referencing requirements for your course with your lecturer.

- Use the *Referencing and attribution* section of the [Australian Government Style Manual (AGSM)](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/) released in 2021 to clarify referencing rules or if you need more examples. This guide is based on this publication.

RMIT Harvard is an author-date referencing style.

RMIT Harvard style requires in-text references and the reference list.

**In-text references** appear within the body of the document. They include the author’s family name or name of the organisation responsible for the information source and the year of publication, with page numbers required for quotes if available.

**A reference list** provides the full bibliographic details of all in-text references at the end of the assignment.

**Note:** Although the AGSM states that the title of online sources should be hyperlinked for electronic formats, RMIT Harvard style does not do this because hyperlinked titles are not compatible with the EndNote program. In addition, the links would not be available when the work is printed.

### General rules for in-text references

- Use in-text references to acknowledge each author or source of information (print or online) used within your writing either by paraphrasing or using a direct quote.  
    
    **Paraphrasing** is when you express the author’s ideas in your own words. Paraphrasing is generally preferred to quotes as they show you understand and can explain the ideas you have read rather than simply copying them.
    
    **A direct quote** is when you use the exact words from the original source. Use quotes sparingly, such as when the exact words of the author are important to the claim you are making. Put direct quotes between single inverted commas (quotation marks). Include a page number in the in-text reference if available.
    
    In-text references include the author’s family name (or company or organisation name, if the author is a company or organisation) and year of publication, with page numbers (if available) required for quotes.
    
- An in-text reference can be inserted at the beginning, middle or end of a sentence. When you are referencing information that authors/researchers agree about, the reference is placed at the end of the sentence (an information prominent citation). This is the most common type of in-text reference. Referencing at the beginning of a sentence (author prominent citation) is used to focus on a particular author/researcher’s point of view or on specific research that might not apply in all situations.

- If the author is integrated as part of the sentence, the date (and page number for direct quote) is placed in parentheses immediately after the author's name.

- When a work has two authors, always list both authors’ names every time the reference occurs. Use the full word **and** when listing the authors in parentheses. For example: (Hill and Martinez-Diez 2020). Also use the full word **and** when mentioning the authors in a sentence. For example: Hill and Martinez-Diez (2020)... .

- When a work has three or more authors, list the first author’s name followed by et al. For example, Haslam et al. (2021) or (Haslam et al. 2021).

- For **pen names and pseudonyms**, use the name adopted by the author, e.g. ...(Mari 2009), Quynh Huong (2020) inspires... In the reference list, list according the pen name or pseudonym and include the author’s actual in parentheses if known.

- If the author of a reference is unknown, list the reference based on the title of the work.

- If the publication date is unknown, use **n.d.** (for 'no date').

- If the publication date is unknown but can be reliably estimated or inferred from the text, then place **c.** (meaning 'circa' or approximately) before the year.

- **Secondary citations** acknowledge the work of an author you refer to in your assignment that you read about in someone else’s work. Where possible, try to use the original source.  
    
    For example, if you use Vanna’s ideas which you read about an article by Martin and Rodríguez, you would only need to show who the ideas belong to and also where you read about them.
    
    > Previous research appears to indicate ... (Vanna, cited in Martin and Rodriguez 2021).
    
    > Vanna (cited in Martin and Rodriguez 2021) suggests that...
    
    In the examples, the ideas/information belong to Vanna, but you paraphrased them from your reading of Martin and Rodriguez’s work.
    
    In the reference list, include the source you read. For this example, you would only need to put Martin and Rodríguez in the reference list.
    
- For **multiple citations in the same parentheses**, list all citations chronologically, separated by a semi-colon (;) for example:  
    
    > It has been claimed that ... (Ghezzi and Cavallo 2018; Jocevski 2020; Soluk et al. 2021).
    
- For **multiple works by the same author in the same year**, insert a letter after the year, starting with the letter ‘a’ for the first work you cite. In the reference list, include the same letter after each year of publication.  
    
    > It is argued that ... (Ayoob 2021a, 2021b).
    
    > Ayoob (2021a, 2021b) states that...
    
- Some works have **different first authors with the same family name**. To identify their works, insert the initial(s) of all the first authors’ given names in the in-text references. In the reference list, order their works by the year of publication.  
    
    > It is argued that ... (Peterson M 2019), but others claim that... (Peterson JR et al. 2021).
    

#### Direct quote

A direct quote is when you are using the exact words of the author(s).

Do not overuse direct quotes.

Put direct quotes between single inverted commas (quotation marks), and add a page number (if available).

If you **change the wording of a quote**, follow the steps below to ensure that you do not to change the meaning of the original text:

- Use an **ellipsis** which consists of three dots (...) if you leave out any part of the original text.

- If you want to add words to the original text (e.g. to integrate the grammar or make the information clearer), you must put them in **square brackets** \[ \].

With direct quotes, always use the spelling and formatting style of the original source.

If the source contains grammatical or spelling errors, you must copy the quote exactly as it appears in the original source (including the errors). Then put sic in parentheses **(sic)** immediately after the error.

A quote in an in-text reference can be inserted at the beginning, middle or end of a sentence.

##### Beginning of a sentence

> Day (2018:3) states that 'writing is a uniquely powerful, precise and satisfying form of expression. It is also a vital skill for future employment'.

##### Middle of a sentence

> In the introduction to their study of consumer purchasing preferences, Liang et al. (2021:163) observe that 'the Internet of Things (IoT), especially smart home technology, has been rapidly advancing and has finally reached mainstream markets and user segments'.

##### End of a sentence

> 'Building plans tend to ignore climate risks in most instances' (Hill and Martinez-Diez 2020:18).

#### Block quotations

Block quotations are quotes of more than 30 words.

Block quotes do not use inverted commas. They are signalled with a colon, and the quote begins on a new line that is indented from the margin and can be set in smaller text size.

As Smithers (2020:57) points out:

> Paraphrasing and synthesising information shows deeper understanding of your reading and research than simply using direct quotes. It enables you to demonstrate your insight into the concepts and thus obtain higher marks in your assignment.

#### Paraphrasing

Paraphrasing is when you are expressing the ideas of the author(s) in your own words.

Paraphrasing in an in-text reference can be inserted at the beginning, middle or end of a sentence.

##### Beginning of a sentence

> Fiorineschi and Rotini (2021) explain that the design discipline commonly recognises novelty as an important factor in assessing creativity.

##### Middle of a sentence

> Using daily rainfall datasets, the Bureau of Meteorology (2022) highlights...

##### End of a sentence

> The Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) program aims to develop students’ professional self and enable them to build and reinvent their practice (Papadopoulou 2020).

### Multiple works by the same author(s) in the same year

Identify works by the same author in the same year by inserting a letter after the year, starting with the letter ‘a’ for the first work you cite, e.g. 2021a, 2021b. In the reference list, include the same letter after each year of publication.

#### In-text reference

> It is argued that...(Ayoob 2021a, 2021b).

> Ayoob (2021a, 2021b) states that...

#### Reference list entry

> Ayoob M (2021a) *How much change will the end of the Netanyahu era bring?*, Australian Strategic Policy Institute: The Strategist website, accessed 9 December 2021. https<nolink>://www.aspistrategist.org.au/how-much-change-will-the-end-of-the-netanyahu-era-bring/
> 
> Ayoob M (2021b) *What will happen to the nuclear deal under Iran’s new president?*, Australian Strategic Policy Institute: The Strategist website, accessed 9 December 2021. https<nolink>://www.aspistrategist.org.au/what-will-happen-to-the-nuclear-deal-under-irans-new-president/

### Referencing Works by different first authors with the same family name

To identify the works of different first authors with the same family name, insert the initial(s) of all the first authors’ given names in the in-text references. In the reference list, order their works by the year of publication.

#### In-text reference

> It is argued that...(Peterson M 2019), but others claim that...(Peterson JR et al. 2021).

#### Reference list entry

In the reference list, order the works of each author by the year of publication. For this example, since Peterson M published their work in 2019 and Peterson JR in 2021, you need to list the Peterson M (2019) reference **before** that of Peterson JR (2021).

### Multiple references in the same parentheses

When including two or more references in the same parentheses in a sentence, list all citations chronologically, separated by a semi-colon (;).

#### In-text reference

> It has been claimed that...(Ghezzi and Cavallo 2018; Jocevski 2020; Soluk et al. 2021).

#### Reference list entry

In the reference list, include the sources you referenced in the parentheses.

### Personal communication

Personal communication, such as face-to-face interviews, conversations, telephone calls, letters or emails, is only cited an in-text reference.

Information about personal communication must be included in the in-text reference. Include the type of personal communication (for example, personal conversation, email, interview, telephone conversation) and the date in a date month year format.

Personal communication is not published and therefore unavailable for verification. For this reason, it is **not** included in the reference list.

#### Paraphrase

> Ms Merrick, Melville Shire Council CEO, confirmed the accuracy of the claims by email on 25 April 2022.

#### Direct quotes

> My field placement supervisor commented '...' (Lee, personal communication, 14 May 2022).

> Rowlands (personal communication, 20 February 2022) stated '...'

### Secondary citation

Secondary citations acknowledge the work of an author you refer to in your writing that you have read about in someone else’s work. Where possible, try to use the original source.

For example, if you use Vanna’s ideas which you read about an article by Martin and Rodríguez, you would only need to show who the ideas belong to and also where you read about them.

#### In-text reference

> Previous research appears to indicate... (Vanna, cited in Martin and Rodriguez 2021).

> Vanna (cited in Martin and Rodriguez 2021) suggests that...

In the examples, the ideas/information belong to Vanna, but you paraphrased them from your reading of Martin and Rodriguez’s work.

#### Reference list entry

In the reference list, include the source you read. For this example, you would **only** need to put the Martin and Rodríguez (2021) reference.

### General rules for the reference list

- Use a reference list at the end of the document to include the publication details of all the in-text references cited within your writing.

- The general order of the elements is:
    - author or authoring organisation’s name
    - publishing date
    - title information
    - publisher details
    - accessed date and URL for digital content

- Start a reference list on a new page using the heading **References**.

- List only references cited in your writing.

- If your lecturer/teacher or supervisor has also requested a bibliography, list any other sources that you have read but not included in your writing under a heading of **Bibliography**.

- The reference list is arranged alphabetically by the family name of the **author**. If the author of a reference is a company or organisation, list the reference based on the first letter of the company or organisation name.

- When the shortened form or acronym of an organisation’s name is mentioned in your work, use it in your references. List the short form, then include the full name in parentheses.

- If there are **multiple entries by the same author**, then arrange chronologically starting with the earliest year of publication.

- If there are **multiple entries by the same author in the same year**, add ‘a’ after the first work, ‘b’ after the second and so on.

- If there are **multiple different first authors with the same family name**, then arrange alphabetically by initial(s) of the first authors' given names.

- If the author used a **pseudonym or pen name**, list that name in the author position. If the actual name is known, place it in parentheses after the pen name, e.g. Mari (Maria Giovanna Colli).

- If the author of a reference is unknown, list the reference based on the title of the work.

- If the publication date of a reference is unknown, use **n.d.** (for 'no date').

- If the publication date is unknown but can be reliably estimated or inferred from the text, then write **c.** (meaning 'circa' or approximately) before the year.

- If there is no place of publication, use **n.p.** (for 'no place').

- If the place of publication (city name) is not commonly known (e.g. Harlow) or the place of publication could be in two or more countries, put the country name after the city. For example, Harlow, England.

- If citing a **PDF**, link to the page where the PDF is hosted not the PDF link.

- If the publication has a **DOI** (Digital Object Identifier), include it in the reference list, at the end of the citation using the short form ‘doi’ in lower case, e.g. Zufferey C, Yu N and Hand T (2020) ‘Researching home in social work’, *Qualitative Social Work*, 19(5-6):1095-1110, doi:10.1177/1473325019880244.

- If the work is in a **language other than English**, put the title in the original language followed by the English translation, e.g. *Gabrielle Chanel. Manifeste de Mode (Gabrielle Chanel. Fashion Manifesto)*.

### Example of a reference list

Below is an example of a reference list displaying various resource types including books, journal articles, legislation, newspaper article, film, report, websites and social media entries. List must be in ascending alphabetical order of author/creator name or, if no name given, in order of title.
